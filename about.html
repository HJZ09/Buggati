    <h3> The company was founded in 1998 as a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group and is based in Molsheim, Alsace, France. The original Bugatti automobile brand was established by Ettore Bugatti (1881â€“1947) in 1909 at Molsheim and built sports, racing and luxury cars.

        In November 2021, the company became part of Bugatti Rimac, a joint venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[3] Since November 1, 2021, the company has been led by Mate Rimac as chief executive officer of Bugatti Rimac.

        On December 22, 1998, Volkswagen AG, a German automotive manufacturer now controlled by Porsche SE, established Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. as a French-registered, wholly-owned subsidiary. On the same day, the company took over the design and naming rights to Bugatti from Italian businessman Romano Artioli, who built supercars (such as the EB 110 and EB 112) with Bugatti SpA in Italy between 1987 and 1998. Since 2000, the Bugatti automobile brand has officially existed as Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., still abbreviated to Bugatti. Since then, the company's headquarters have once again been located in Molsheim, France.
